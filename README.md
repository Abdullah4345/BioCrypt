<h1>BioCrypt - Biometric-Integrated File Encryption System</h1>

<p align="left"><br><br>BioCrypt is an advanced biometric-based encryption system designed to secure sensitive files using fingerprint authentication and AES-256 encryption. By integrating biometric authentication, local and cloud storage options, secure email transfers, and blockchain-secured IPFS storage, BioCrypt offers a robust and user-friendly solution for file security in an era of increasing cyber threats.<br><br>Key Features<br>	•	Biometric Authentication: Files are encrypted and decrypted using a key derived from the user’s fingerprint.<br>	•	AES-256 Encryption: Industry-standard encryption ensures the highest level of security for all files.<br>	•	The Vault: Secure local encrypted storage with OTP-protected access.<br>	•	The Cloud: Encrypted file storage using Google Drive with OTP authentication for retrieval and deletion.<br>	•	SafeMail: Secure file transfer via email with pre-encryption and attached decryption code to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.<br>	•	AI File Summarization: Optional smart preview for encrypted files without full decryption.<br>	•	TimeGuard: Time-locked storage with automatic deletion after a set time or failed access attempts.    <br>	•	SecureFileBeam: Encrypted file transfer over Bluetooth for offline secure sharing.<br>	•	Interactive Help Bot: Provides real-time assistance within the application.<br>	•	Customizable Themes: Includes a high-contrast mode for improved accessibility.<br>	•	IPFS & Blockchain Integration<br><br><br>Security Highlights<br>	•	AES-256 encryption for all files.<br>	•	Fingerprint hash-based key generation.<br>	•	OTP authentication for file retrieval.<br>	•	End-to-end encryption for file transfers.<br>	•	Anti-spoofing fingerprint mechanisms.<br>	•	Blockchain-logged IPFS storage for tamper-proof integrity. <br><br></p>

  <h2>The Vault</h2>
<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/vault.png" alt="Vault" style="width: 40%;">
</div>
<p>The Vault: This program is just a simple encrypted storage where the files are saved locally on the device but only the
user who inserted his file will be able to retrieve it using OTP sent to him via E-mail.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <h2>Google Cloud</h2>
<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/google.png" alt="Google" style="width: 40%;">
</div>
<p>Cloud: This program is a cloud based encrypted storage where the files are saved on Google Drive but only the user who
inserted his file will be able to retrieve it using OTP sent to him via E-mail.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">
  <h2>Chain Space</h2>
<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/ipfs.png" alt="Chain Space" style="width: 40%;">
</div>
<p>ChainSpace: This program uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) along with the Ethereum Blockchain to deliver one of
the most secure ways to store an encrypted file, the way IPFS works is that it divides the file to many smaller pieces
(256kb) and spread them across decentralized servers around the world, then the program insert the CID (content
Identification) to the Ethereum Blockchain to ensure integrity, the same CID which will be used to retrieve the files from
all the servers and create the file back.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h2>Safe Mail</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/safe-mail.png" alt="Safe Mail" style="width: 40%;">
  
</div>

  
<p>Safe Mail: This program is one of the most demanded programs of all support features according to the reviwers
and the community around BioCrypt as the program uses encryption methods similer to the one found in whatsapp
which is P2P where the program doesn’t have a encryption key pool, the program instead uses Math to create the
key every time, the key is a combination of 6 digit code that will be sent to the reciver as well as a 6 digit security
code that belongs to the company or department, the program combines both codes and form a AES-256 encryption
key, the same procces happens to the reciver, he enters his security code as well as the code found on his mail and
the program uses the same function to try and figure the encryption key.</p>

<h2>AI Summaries</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/summarie.png" alt="AI Summaries" style="width: 70%;">
</div>
<p>Summaries: an AI program that uses Gemni-1.5 pro to capture a quick overview of the files before encrypting and
storing it if the user pleases, This feature allows text, audio, video, and image summarization before encryption. The
AI-generated summary is also encrypted and stored securely.</p>

  <h2>Chat Bot</h2>
<img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/jyx7871cz/chatbot.png" alt="AI Summaries" style="width: 50%;">
</div>
<p>Assistant: an AI chatbot that uses the same model as summaries (Gemni-1.5 pro) to assist the user in navigating the program.
The intelligent assistant "Help Bot" has been developed as part of the BioCrypt project, an
advanced security system that uses fingerprint authentication to encrypt and protect files from
unauthorized access. The Help Bot aims to enhance the user experience by providing instant
support and answers to frequently asked questions, reducing the need for human technical
support.</p>
